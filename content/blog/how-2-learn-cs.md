- this is basically a guide to self-taught for traditional cs concepts
- mostly useful for a hollistic knowledge, or getting ahead on a degree
- how I would do it again
- presents a "minimal path": there is no such thing, and there is, by necessity inefficiency, but *the reader should choose their own* (preferably smething they're excited about): I'll present the baseline and try to minimize nonsense

- bootstrapping (learning something from nothing) (python)
- web fundamentals (html+js+css)
- low-level (C (K&R), a teaspoon of ASM and hardware)
- DSA (leetcode, 6.006)
- Tooling (Shell (linux pocket guide) + GNU Coreutils, git, vim (when you're bored))

The rest is pretty unimportant: make projects, aim for volume and variation.
Here are some ideas:

(easier earlier on):
- web dev (frameworks, static sites, typescript)
- learn new languages (derek banas tutorial, learn X in Y, read [shortest] doc book, lazy-learn), write projects in those language
- work with existing tooling and libraries

(slightly harder):
- do more systems-y stuff
- full-stack (+all the tooling)

(probably wait)
- Contribute to Open-Source
- Built large-scale programs (this bullet primarily implies that other projects should aim low: it's useful to build big projects, but not feasible early on. This is generally self-enforcing, but being aware of it might make planning easier)
