When people ask me why I've chosen CS over other majors/careers, I usually respond something along the lines of: "Computers have interested me since my youth", or "I'm driven by the creative power of computers".
These are understatements, though, and they do a poor job at conveying the nature of my feelings towards CS.
The real reason is something more like "I'm drawn to computers because they are magic".
That response probably wouldn't do too well in a job interview, but I think it's a much more compelling idea, so I've decided to outline it here.

## Noticing Similarities

I don't think "magic" can be formally defined; most of its meaning is carried in its connotations.
Instead, I will make direct comparisons between traditional magic and computers.

### Power and Exchange

- computers can change the world in ways we otherwise could not, and in ways we can't understand
    - technology in general
        - computers are special, because practically anybody can learn to program

- amount of work != amount of output

### The Supernatural

- making use of supernatural (power that you should not be able to harness)

## Extended Metaphor

- extended metaphor
    - paradigms are different forms of magic (i.e. functional is black magic)
    - languages are different dialects of those forms
    - tools <=> magic wand, etc
        - kind of like the cover of the dragon book

## So What?

- you want to do something interesting? Why aren't you doing it?
    - is it because there isn't something interesting
    - or because you fail the see the beauty in reality?
