Note: this isn't a security post: "hacking" here means "unclean coding", i.e. "I quickly hacked together a shell script as a temporary fix to the issue". Sorry, cybersecurity enthusiasts.

- "there are two types of programmers: those who write good code, and those who get stuff done"
    - "there are those that make games and there are those that write good code"
- I know I like to talk about this stuff a lot, and claim all the great parts of trying to write optimal code...
- wicked problems => hacking is often a necessity (you don't even know a solution)
    - when we are building projects, we're building an understanding ourselves
        - it isn't feasible to have a perfect understanging of stuff
- reframing is very costly (though it might be ideal in the long-run)
- it's also incredibly computationally difficult
- if it ain't broke don't fix it
- Principles from the ["cult of done manifesto"](https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13):
    2.  Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
    4.  Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it.
    8. "Laugh at perfection. It’s boring and keeps you from being done."
