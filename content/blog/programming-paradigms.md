## Ideas and Code

Writing code is a never-ending battle to translate abstract ideas into formal instructions.
This translation is lossy by nature: by making our ideas concrete, we are forced to face their inherent complexity, and the bewilderingly large set of ways to arrange their inner-workings.

Programming is ultimately about coping with this complexity, often by imposing extra constraints, for example:

- Programming Language Syntax
- Style/Structural Conventions
- Idioms
- Design Patterns

The goal is for these rules to narrow the scope of possible translations, reducing the likelihood of out-of-control complexity.
However, the rules aren't perfect, and they almost always leave something to be desired.
This framework for expression of ideas is all too often at odds with the ideas themselves.
Furthermore, the framework iteslf can have unintentional influence on the ideas: as a programmer becomes more comfortable with a translation method, it becomes increasingly harder to draw the line between the ideas and their translations.

This is why I (like so many others) am so interested in trying to deeply understand less-popular programming paradigms[^fun-to-learn].
My goal is to train myself to deeply understand the formulation of ideas by analyzing their translations through a variety of constraint-sets.

[^fun-to-learn]: They're also a lot of fun to learn.
