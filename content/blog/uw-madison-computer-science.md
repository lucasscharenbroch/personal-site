I like to plan things out, especially things of high importance. Since college happens to fall into that category, I've spent a significant amount of time planning out courses, and I've made a habit of studying for every math/cs course *before* the class begins. I was able to do both of these things with the help of online resources, many of which were student-created. I intend for this post to serve as an overview of the degree requirements and my experience with the classes for anybody who may be interested in what the degree entails or how to go about it. My main focus is the Computer Science major, but there is some overlap with general degree requirements.

## General Resources
- [Official CS Requirements (BS)](https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/letters-science/computer-sciences/computer-sciences-bs/#requirementstext) &mdash; BS and BA are almost the same, except for general requirements
- [Public Course Search & Enroll](https://public.enroll.wisc.edu/search) &mdash; Central site for class availability and enrollment.
- [Noguera's Course Map](https://www.noguera.dev/course-map/) &mdash; Great visualization of CS course dependencies.
- [UW Discord Server](https://discord.com/college) &mdash; A center for classes, clubs, and general banter.
- [Rui Pan's Course Guide](https://ruipan.xyz/wisc_courses.html) &mdash; Similar to this post.
- [UPL](https://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/coords.html) &mdash; The UPL has a course night every semester; see their discord server for slides.

## Requirement Clarifications
The university lays things out pretty well, but there are some small ambiguities due to the non-programatic definition of the requirements. It turns out that [DARS](https://registrar.wisc.edu/dars/) is the soultion to this issue (you can find it more details in Course Search and Enroll and Noguera's page (see above)), but here are a few clarifications that I was initially uncetain of.

- Any subset of degree requirement from the set {General Education (Quantatative Reasoning A and B, Communication A and B, Ethnic Studies), Breadth (Natural/Physical/Biological Science, Literature, etc.), Difficulty (Intermediate/Advanced), Other Degree Requirement (for CS: Theory of CS, Software/Hardware, Applications, Electives, etc.)} can be fulfilled by a single course, but no element in the set can be fufilled *more than once* by a single course.
- This also means that courses that can be retaken for credit (i.e. Music 113, "Clap for Credit") only count towards their respective breadth the first time around
- Literature is a subset of Humanities: all Literature-Breadth courses also count for Humanities Breadth (a class taken for Literature credit also counts for Humanities, despite the above rule).
- Retroactive credits are *only* earned with a B or higher.
- The Summer Session credit limit rule applies on a per-session-basis: i.e. "no more than x credits in an x-week session" implies (assuming x is the 8-week session DHH) "no more than 8 credits in DHH". This doesn't add any restrictions on sessions that may overlap with DHH, despite the average credit per week potentially exceeding 1 credit.
- "In-Residence" doesn't literally imply "Living in Madison". Online classes through UW count as "In-Residence".

## The Plan

My goal is to graduate in as few semesters as possible. This is for two main reasons (1) I like pushing the limits: the rewards of my efforts seem to be proportional to the amount of work I put in, so I refuse to purposely hold back. (2) College is expensive. We could go into the details, but you probably get the point.

I think that this reasoning is relatively straightforward and probably relatable for a lot of people, but my advisor refused to even discuss a 2-year plan, repeatedly insisting that I rethink my plan, or else my mental health and networking opportunities were at stake. I bring this up to point out that my advisor was not entirely wrong: such a plan *is not* fit for everybody, and there are certainly *some* opportunities that will be missed by graduating early. At the same time, I think it's closed-minded to assume that such a plan is not fit for *any* student, and that the opportunities gained by graduating later necessarily outweigh the cost (namely the financial vulnerability) incurred by extra semesters. I am not an extraordinary student, but I did put a considerable amount of work in to prepare for classes and study CS in general. I encourage anybody considering early graduation to consider the opportunity costs of *all* of the options, and to avoid underestimating their own abilities.

## CS Requirements
### CS 200 &mdash; Programming I
An intro to programming fundamentals and Java syntax. I tested out of CS200 with the [self-assessment](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/cs-200-300-placement-self-assessment/), so I can't speak about the class as a whole, but I did read through almost all of the [slides online](https://cs200-www.cs.wisc.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/), which essentially covered a subset [Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html) (plus some more explanations of basic programming concepts and style guidelines), which I had read earlier in the summer. The self-assessment was consisted of a project ([peg solitaire](https://cs300-www.cs.wisc.edu/wp/peg-solitaire/), which was slightly easier than the average CS300 assignment), a short (30 question) sample CS200 final exam (which mainly covered basic syntax), and a "reflection".

### CS 300 &mdash; Programming II
An overview of [Object-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and fundamental [Data Structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure). Like 200, the [course slides](https://cs300-www.cs.wisc.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/) can be found online. The OOP portion is also almost completely overlapping with the Java Tutorials, but 300 also highlights a few more implementation details of how arrays and references work (i.e. heap vs stack), which are further iterated in 354. The Data Structures covered (linked lists, trees, heaps) are generally considered fundamental (they're asked about in a lot of [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/) problems), but aren't practically very useful, because they're implemented in most languages' standard libraries. The class itself consists of quizzes and exams (both in the same canvas-quiz format), programming assignments, as well as a mandatory online textbook through [zybooks](https://www.zybooks.com/) (a few other intro CS courses use zybooks as well; to earn the points, you must click through the readings and answer some basic "challenge" activities). The programming assignments involve fill-in-the-blank functionality (i.e. a method's documentation is given, and you must write it) and writing testers. While the programs aren't inherently complicated, there is a mandatory style guide, which requires the use of [javadoc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javadoc) comments, which are (in my opinion) incredibly verbose (for the uses of this class); this, in combination with the verbose nature of Java itself, makes the programs much harder to work with.

### CS 400 &mdash; Programming III
Sundries. This course attempts to cover lots of miscellaneous practical knowledge for programming (Bash, Git, Make, HTML/CSS/JS, Regex) along with a crossover between 300's tougher concepts and 577's easier concepts (Hash Maps, [Balanced BSTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree), Shortest Path, [Minimum Spanning Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree)), along with some more specialized Java tools and language features (JUnit, JavaFX, Lambda Expressions). Projects are done in groups of eight students (with two subgroups of four working on separate instances of the implementation), and serve as a way to practice all of the material (using the tools to work on projects related to the DSA concepts). There were also some weekly quizzes and activities sprinkled in to supplement the projects. The class was about as crazy as it sounds, but it worked surprisingly well. The projects were unsurprisingly messy, but considering the team aspect and the fact that the programs were completely designed by the teams (in comparison to the fill-in-the-blank methods of 200-300), I was impressed when our projects came together and worked as expected (almost).

### CS/Math 240 &mdash; Intro to Discrete Math
Basic Logic, Proof Techniques, Graph Theory, Set Theory, and Combinatorics. I took this class with the Math Department (Prof. Sobieska); I've heard that there were previously big differences between the Math and CS version, but this one seemed to mirror [Dieter's Notes](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~hasti/cs240/readings/) almost exactly, which are apparently the basis for the CS version. The class was laid out almost exactly like a typical math class, except that the textbook was through zybooks. Most of the material in this course is immediately relevant for 577 (the more popular of the two options for the Theory of CS requirement).

### CS 252 &mdash; Intro to Computer Engineering
Computation at the binary, transistor, logic-gate, machine-language, and assembly-language levels. The class began with binary representations of integers, then rapidly jumped abstractions, finishing with a description of the [LC3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Computer_3) ("Little Computer 3") architecture. Having already read a [book](https://www.asmirvine.com/) on x86 assembly and worked on a [project (of sorts)](https://github.com/lucasscharenbroch/ASMUtilityLibrary) with it, the assembly and binary logic portions of this course seemed trivial. The quizzes and exams were identical to the homework (with slight differences), but they were auto-graded through canvas, so a single mistake often meant a ~5% deduction. As one might imagine, this was pretty cruel when working with (binary) machine code and bitwise operations.


### CS 354 &mdash; Machine Organization and Programming
(fall 2023)

## CS/Math Electives
### Math 340 &mdash; Elementary Matrix & Linear Algebra<a name="340"></a>
An introduction to the axioms of Linear Algebra. The first three chapters or so outlined relationships between linear systems and matrices, properties of matrices, matrix multiplication, and matrix inversion. The remainder of the course consisted mostly of memorizing a number of properties of matrices or vector-spaces that had implications on other properties of matrices (i.e. A is invertible <=> Ax = 0 has only the trivial solution <=> A is row (or column) equivalent to I[n] <=> the linear system Ax = b has a unique solution for every b in R^n <=> A is a product of elementary matrices <=> det(A) != 0 <=> the rank of A is n <=> the nullity of A is 0). I took this class at the same time as CS240, which was helpful because although there were no proofs in 340, there was some use of set theory and basic logic that wasn't completely explained. 340, unlike 341 (which requires Calc 3 as a prerequisite) is *not a proof based class*: the professor and TAs made this very clear, and often used it as an excuse not to explain certain properties (whose simplest explanation would likely require a proof). It was kind of amusing hearing "this is not a proof based class" as a slogan, but it certainly didn't make the material more intuitive, and as a result, the class consisted almost entirely of memorizing properties, which made the class easy, but not very interesting.

### CS 368 &mdash; Learn a Programming Language: Python
Zybooks for credit. There were weekly lectures, but attendance was work 5%, while the class was pass/fail (with 80% or above being a pass), and the other 95% was zybooks. In addition to the usual zybooks, there were "zybooks labs" at the end of each chapter, which were similar to leetcode easy problems, often with a few more implementation difficulties. The coverage of Python was in general quite rudimentary (the zybook was an intro-programming-with-Python book), but there were some useful topics covered (list comprehensions, advanced uses of f-strings, variadic functions, etc.).
