# Introduction

{{% img-right-aside src="/images/me.jpg" alt="Lucas Scharenbroch" class="headshot" %}}

Hi, I'm Lucas.
I recently graduated from [UW-Madison](/blog/uw-madison-computer-science), and now I program professionally.
I like to work on projects and learn new technologies in my free time, some of which can be found here.
